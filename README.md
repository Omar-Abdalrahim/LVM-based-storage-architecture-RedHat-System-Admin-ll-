# LVM-based-storage-architecture-RedHat-System-Admin-ll-
Designed and deployed a fully extensible LVM-based storage architecture separating ingestion and analysis workloads on an 8GB disk to improve scalability and data organization. Built automated pipelines, including a daily ingestion script with high-ratio compression, and auto-scaling monitor scripts that expand logical volumes when usage exceeds thresholds, with fail-safe logic preventing ingestion when scaling is not possible. Implemented SELinux policies to securely serve HTML reports under /analyses/reports via HTTP, ensuring correct context labeling for all generated files.
